Hello ðŸ‘‹,

I'm a recent Applied Computer Science graduate from Northwest Missouri State University with about 2 years of frontend development experience. I'm particularly interested in how AI can enhance user interfaces.


During my time at Capgemini, I built responsive React components and worked closely with design teams to create accessible user experiences. The work gave me solid experience in frontend fundamentals and collaborating on larger projects.

Recently, I've been working on some personal projects that blend AI with frontend development - including a real-time speech feedback app called SPEAK and an emotion-aware chat assistant called RAISE. I'm also contributing to the tech team at One Community Global, helping with their open-source development work.

I enjoy building products that feel natural to use, especially when there's AI working behind the scenes. Right now I'm looking for opportunities in frontend development or roles that involve designing AI-powered user experiences.
