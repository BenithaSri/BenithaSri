Recent graduate in Applied Computer Science from Northwest Missouri State University, with 2+ years of professional experience in frontend development and a growing focus on AI/ML integration.

At Capgemini, I built accessible, high-performance UIs using React.js and CSS, collaborated with cross-functional teams, and delivered responsive, scalable components that improved user experience.

Iâ€™ve recently expanded into AI-driven applications â€” leading projects like SPEAK (speech performance feedback) and RAISE (real-time emotion-aware chat), combining real-time audio analysis with human-centric design.

Iâ€™m passionate about building intelligent, user-focused interfaces and currently seeking opportunities in frontend or AI-integrated product roles.
